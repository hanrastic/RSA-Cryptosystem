# Weekly report 2
## What was done?
- Did more research on the topic
- Scetched the program architecture
- Coded some key functions like; create the prime numbers, test for primality, generate the RSA keys
- Also coded test for primaly chencing function 
## What did I learn?
- I learned how the Miller-Rabin algorithm works
- Learned how prime numbers can be generated efficiently
- Learned a bit more about python
## What is unclear?
- Still have not decided if I should make a graphic UI
- What functions to make for the user. 
    - User can create the keys
    - User can encrypt and decrypt messages
    - What else?
## What next?
- Decision for the UI implementation.
- Finish the testing for the already made functions
- Add codecov for the project
- Start to code the encryption and decryping functions
## Used hours
- 14 hours
    - 5 on researching
    - 9 on coding
