# Määrittelydokumentti

## Project
The project is a encryption program that uses RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) as the encryption method.

## Programming languages
I will be using python for this project since I want to get better at it. I also know Java. The main documentation and coding language will Be English.

## Algorithms and data stuctures
### Algorithms
- Sieve of Eratosthenes for creating all the prime numbers till n.
  - Time complexity goal: O(k log³ n), where k number of loops and n the number to be tested.
- Miller-Rab algorithm for checking if the number is a prime number.
  -  Time complexity goal: O(n log log n), where n is the number to be generated prime numbers until.
### Data structures
- There seems to be no need for any larger data structures than just basic variables. For simplicity I will be using basic variables for storing the prime numbers.
